You can change the size of the canvas by clicking the buttons.

The 'resolution' selection will define how many pixels to render in the x and y axis.

This operates by slightly reducing the opacity of pixels when a mouseover event is fired. 

Rainbow mode will set the pixel colour to a random RGB hex value on mouseover.
